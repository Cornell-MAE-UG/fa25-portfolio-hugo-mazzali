For my thermodynamics course ENGRD 2210, I had analyzed a water-water heat exchanger that transfers thermal energy from a hot water stream to a cold water stream without mixing the two fluids. An immersion heater maintains a hot water reservoir, while an insulated cooler is the cold resevoir. Each Resevoir has a pump that drives water through one of the two internal flow passages of the heat exchanger

The hot stream enters the heat exchanger at high temperature, flows along its passages, and exits at a lower temperature. The cold steam does the same but exits at a higher temperature. 

We analyzed two different heat exchanger set ups: Parallel flow and Cross flow.

    <p>
      In parallel flow, the two streams enter the heat exchanger together, and flow in the same direction. This causes the system to have a large initial temperature difference, but provides little effectiveness regarding the purpose of the heat exchanger.

      In cross flow, the fluids move in opposite directions. Given the data of this experiment, we found that this flow-orientation was more effective for exchanging heat between the two fluids. We characterized the effectiveness by comparing both the temperature difference as well as the time taken for the temperature to change.
