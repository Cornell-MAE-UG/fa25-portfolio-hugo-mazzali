For my thermodynamics course ENGRD 2210, I had analyzed a water-water heat exchanger that transfers thermal energy from a hot water stream to a cold water stream without mixing the two fluids. An immersion heater maintains a hot water reservoir, while an insulated cooler is the cold resevoir. Each Resevoir has a pump that drives water through one of the two internal flow passages of the heat exchanger

The hot stream enters the heat exchanger at high temperature, flows along its passages, and exits at a lower temperature. The cold steam does the same but exits at a higher temperature. 

We analyzed two different heat exchanger set ups: Parallel flow and Cross flow.
