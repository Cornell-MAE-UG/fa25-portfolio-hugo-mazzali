 This is a final project for MAE 3260 (System Dynamics) course. The
group was tasked with learning about and developing a control behavior for a system of our choice. Our group decided on a ball on a beambecause of its physical nature, as well as its uniqueness comparedwith other systems of study throughout the semester. The system isas follows: a ball is placed on a beam at an arbitrary position withan arbitrary velocity, with the beam at an arbitrary angle moving at an arbitrary angular velocity.
