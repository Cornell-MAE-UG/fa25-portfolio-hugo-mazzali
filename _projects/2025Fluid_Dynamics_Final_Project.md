In a group of 4, I dissected and analyzed the fluid mechanical operation system of a sonic humidifier. We created a short video summary of our findings and analysis you can watch here [make this a link].

My focus on this project was understanding how the speaker allowed for moisture to be added to the air without heating.

Aside from this mechanical analysis, I created a diagram of the entire system, drew the streamlines of the systems, and worked on vairous equations regarding the impeller, the pressure difference within the tank, and the drag on the water particles produced by the humidifier. 

What my research showed was that the speaker vibrated at a frequency between 1 and 3 MHz, which would create unstable, standing waves. These waves break at their crest and create little droplets that are a few micrometers in diameter. Me and another group member performed the calculations below to understand how these droplets were able to rise by relating the drag force on the droplets and the velocity of the air around them. Many assumptions were made for these calculations since we lacked precise measuring equipment.
